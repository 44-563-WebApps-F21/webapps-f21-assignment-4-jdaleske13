        <h2>Vera, or the Nihilists</h2>
        <h3>Act 4: Vera makes it to the Czar to Save Russia</h3>
        <p class="stage_directions">SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it._</p>

        <p class="stage_directions">_Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT
        ROUVALOFF.</p>


        <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO.</h4> 
        <p class="speech prince">He is beginning well, this young Czar.</p>

        <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF</h4> 
        <p class="stage_directions">(_shrugs his shoulders_).</p> 
        <p class="speech baron">All young Czars do begin well.</p>

        <h4 class="name">COUNT R.</h4> 
        <p class="speech count">And end badly.</p>

        <h4 class="name">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4> 
        <p class="speech marq">Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
        good service, at any rate.</p>

        <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO.</h4> 
        <p class="speech prince">Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?</p>

       <h4 class="name">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4> 
       <p class="speech marq">Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an hour.</p>

        <p class="stage_directions">(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)</p>

        <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF.</h4> 
        <p class="speech baron">Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?</p>

        <h4 class="name">GEN. KOTEMK.</h4> 
        <p class="speech gen">You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
        I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
        players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
        recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>

        <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO.</h4> 
        <p class="speech prince">Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
        common murderers!</p>
